This is a fortran 90 program. We have used NAGware f95 compiler, and I don't 
know how it works with other compilers. Please let me know if you have any 
problems.

Structure:


1. bin/ 
 * contents: input files, executables, pdb file
   a. Following input files that should not be changed:	
	topology_eng.in, topology_geo.in, parameters.in
   b. You can change 
      user_input.in:
	first column should not be changed.
      entries:
  	IN_PDB_NAME : input pdb file name
	PRINT_LEVEL : prints nothing if 0, prints something if > 0.
	MINIMIZE_AT_SETUP:
	        if YES, minimize potential starting from the pdb
		structure in setup_potential
        TIME_COHERENT:
		if YES, make use of the temporal coherence
		if NO, do not make use of the temporal coherence 
			in potential calculation

2. src/ 
 * contents: source files, makefile,
            src/aux/ (contains lbfgs-b minimization routine)
 * subroutines: You can find the usage of the following routines in
	       main.F90.
   a. setup_potential()
	read a pdb file (pdb file name should be given in the input file,
	bin/user_input.in), and setup everything.
 	If MINIMIZE_AT_SETUP = NO, set the protein structure to
	the pdb structure. If YES, set the protein structure to
	the energy minimized pdb structure. All degrees of freedom 
	are set to the (energy minimized) pdb values.
	Miscellaneous notes:
	 - Many pdb files have missing atoms, such as hydrogen. This routine
	   puts in those atoms using some canonical bond lengths and angles.
	 - Disulfide bond info will also be read from the pdb file. 
  	   If you do not wish to include disulfide bonds, 
	   please make sure that there is no 'SSBOND' entry in the pdb file.
	 - If multiple structures are given in the pdb file, only the first
	   structure will be read.
   b. finalize_potential()
	finalize everything.
	should be called at the end of the program.
   c. potential(dim, phi, psi, omega, f)
	I assume that following choice is natural. If your convention is
	different, please let me know.

	dim: should be equal to the number of residues - 1
	phi, psi, omega : double precision arrays of dimension dim.
		all angles are in units of radian, not degree.
		phi(i): phi angles of the (i+1)th residue
		psi(i), omega(i): psi and omega angles of the ith residue
	f: potential at given phi, psi, omega, and all other variables 
	   	at native (or energy minimized, if minimize_energy() is
		called after setup_potential) values
   f. get_phipsi(dim, phi, psi, omega)
	get phi, psi, omega of the current structure.
	dim, phi, psi, omega as defined above.
   f. write_pdb(out_pdb_name)
	write a pdb file of the current structure.

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Thanks,
