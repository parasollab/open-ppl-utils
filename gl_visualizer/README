This utility is a generic visualizer based on OpenGL. To use it, create a
visualization class that inherits from the base_visualization class (see
example_visualization for a demo).

NOTE: This utility requires a fully C++11 compliant compiler, like gcc 4.9 or
      greater. As of November 2016, our systems use gcc 4.8 by default. Before
      building, you will need to load the module for a newer version:
      - Use 'module avail' to check which modules are available.
      - Use 'module load xyz' to load a module named 'xyz'. Load a gcc module
        that is at least 4.9 or newer.
      - Build as normal with 'make' from the sandbox directory.

What's in here:

nonstd:
  A collection of utilities that aren't in the std namespace but reasonably
  could belong there, like approximate equality and a string tokenizer.

glutils:
  A collection of utilities for working with OpenGL, like camera and transform
  objects.

sandbox:
  The visualizer code, which is based on Qt. Run make from this folder to build
  the visualizer.
